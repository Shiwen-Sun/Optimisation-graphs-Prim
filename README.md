# Optimisation-graphs-Prim


The main objective of this session is to implement Prim’s algorithm to compute Minimum Spanning Trees. The lab
is language agnostic, i.e., you can choose whatever programming language you prefer to implement it.
Prim’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm: it solves the problem by locally optimal choices at each stage.
